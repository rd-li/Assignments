PROJ4:  the executable
main.cpp:   driver, and the functions for the driver (including the functions for checking if a string can be split into words)
node.cpp, node.h: node class. for trie tree
trie.cpp, trie.h: trie class. methods include: addWord and searchWord. (which is what we need for this lab)

===========================
5 test cases (given): test1.txt test2.txt test3.txt test4.txt test5.txt
output: the output for those five test cases (run PROJ4 once should give the output for all five test cases)
